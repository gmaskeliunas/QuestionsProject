# Hello, this is my project from Turing College.

This is a learning tool, that allows for a user to add questions and answers and later practice them.
There are two modes for adding questions: quiz questions and free-form questions. 
Each user is allowed to practice and take scored tests whenever at least 5 questions are added for a specified mode.

## To run the program use command python main.py

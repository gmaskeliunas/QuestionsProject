# Hello, this is my project from Turing College.
This is a learning tool, that allows for a user to add questions and answers and later practice them.
There are two modes for adding questions: quiz questions of free-form questions. 
Each user is allowed to practice or take scored tests whenever there are at least 5 questions are added for a specified mode.
